# ayon-openpype-import

Allows importing OpenPype 3 projects into AYON database.

Please keep in mind that this tools is meant not meant to migrate any OpenPype project to AYON mid-production, but rather help you import finished projects, so you don't have to run two pipelines in parallel and can still access your previous productions. As far as our internal testing goes, OpenPype project should be fully compatible with all of the workflows once imported to AYON, but we dont' recommend relying on such converted project for full production.
